Why MVC?
========

The MVC pattern brings modularity to application developers and it enables:

- Reusable and extendable code
- Separation of view logic from business logic
- Allow simultaneous work between developers who are responsible for different components (such as UI layer and core logic)
- Easier to maintain
- Easier to test
