<!--
  Refactor the code so the arrow will change the color to blue on mouse hover.

  All relevant resources are located in the folder "assets/bg-sprite"

  Restrictions:
  - Don’t change any of the existing CSS properties
  - You can use `padding-right: 35px` to make space for the background
  - Don’t add `div` or `span` for background
  - Should be able to tell why sprite is better than 2 images
  - Research what other background properties can help you with the sprite image height not fitting
