      <h1>London</h1>
      <p>London is the political, economic and cultural capital of Britain, and its world class tourist attractions are renowned across the globe. The Greater London area is bursting with attractions for visitors of all ages. With 30 historic gardens and 123 historic buildings, London also has more than 200 museums, 600 cinema screens, and 108 music halls. London's 33 boroughs, including the City of London, are spread over an area of 1572 square kilometres.</p>

      <p>The river Thames runs through the heart of London, from Richmond in the west, through the central London borough of Westminster, to Greenwich in the east. London river cruises and river buses are a great way to see the city.</p>

      <p>About one third of London is devoted to parks and open spaces, so there are plenty of places to relax on fine days.</p>

      <p>London is incredibly well-connected, with five international airports and the high-speed Eurostar rail link. More than 50 countries are within a three-hour flight time and 310 international destinations have direct links to London.</p>
